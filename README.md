# Breast Cancer Data Analysis

This repository contains a complete data analysis and machine learning workflow using the provided `breast-cancer.csv` dataset. The analysis includes data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and insights.

## Files
- `task.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all code and analysis steps.
- `breast-cancer.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
- `.gitignore`: Standard Python and Jupyter ignore rules.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## How to Run
1. Install requirements:
   ```powershell
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Open `task.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells.

## Project Steps
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
4. Feature selection/engineering
5. Model selection and training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
6. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
7. Conclusion and insights
